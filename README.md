# Intercollegiate Mental Health Conference
Intercollegiate Mental Health Conference Repo


On September 16, 2017 the Georgia Tech student body witnessed the tragic death of Scout
Schultz. They were the President of Pride Alliance and a beloved student leader on campus. It
was clear to student leadership that this event was indicative of systemic issues related to mental
health on campus. In response, we worked alongside other student leadership and administration
to establish two major initiatives: Action Teams and a one-million dollar fund for mental health
initiatives managed by the Mental Health Joint Allocations Committee (MHJAC). The Action
Teams had one month to analyze and produce recommendations in the areas of: LGBTQIA+,
Mental Health, and Campus Culture. Upon completion and reflection, it was noted that Tech was
severely lacking in its ability to benchmark Tech's mental health systems against other colleges.
Furthermore, few of the recommendations produced were new ideas that had not been discussed
before. We realized that a primary barrier to improving mental health was a lack of knowledge
on programs and policies proven to work on other campuses. Poor mental health on college
campuses is the rule, not the exception. In turn, each college has had to develop a set of practices
to best address the issues they face. Why, then, are we trying to build a wheel with little
knowledge or guidance when a detailed blueprint and analysis may already exist?
With all of this in mind, the Intercollegiate Mental Health Conference was a logical progression
of thought. We call it a conference, but at its core IMHC is a research initiative to identify,
evaluate, and share the principal components of effective college mental health systems. This is
an ambitious project that has potential to save lives and improve the higher education experience
for all students. IMHC is the first national student conference focused on best practices for
mental health that we are aware of. There is a great deal of work to be done beyond IMHC and a
long journey ahead, yet we find solace knowing the next step forward is one we take together.
